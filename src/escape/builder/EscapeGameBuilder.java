/**
 * This class builds an instance of an EscapeGameManager from a configuration
 * file (.egc). This uses the EscapeConfigurator for XML to turn the .egc file
 * into a valid XML string that is then unmarshalled into an EscapeGameInitializer
 * file.
 *
 * The Escape Configuration Tool JAR file is required for this class to compile and
 * run correctly. The file also requires the ANTLR 4 JAR file. Both of these JAR files are
 * in the lib directory of this IntelliJ project.
 *
 * NOTE: The Escape Configuration Tool was built with Java 17.
 * 
 * MODIFIABLE: YES
 * MOVEABLE: NO
 * REQUIRED: YES
 * 
 * You must change this class to be able to get the data from the configurtion
 * file and implement the makeGameManager() method. You may not change the signature
 * of that method or the constructor for this class. You can change the file any 
 * other way that you need to.
 * 
 * You don't have to use the EscapeGameInitializer object if
 * you have a way that better suits your design and capabilities. Don't go down
 * a rathole, however, in order to use something different. This implementation
 * works and will not take much time to modify the EscapeGameInitializer to create
 * your game instance. Just creating the game instance should take as little time
 * as possible to implement.
